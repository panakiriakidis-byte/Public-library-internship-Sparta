## Week 1 – Creating a Simple Web Server Using Python and PHP

The first week focused on creating a basic web server that displays predefined messages on a web page, implemented using both Python and PHP. Below are the steps followed to install the required programming environments and set up the Python version of the project.

### 1️⃣ Python Setup
#### 1. Create the Project Folder

Create a folder named **Project_Folder** in the path:

C:\

#### 2. Create the Python File (app.py)

Using Notepad, create a new file named **app.py** and paste the Python code shown in the folder **week-01** of this repository.
Save the file inside **Project_Folder**, making sure to select **"All Files"** before saving.

#### 3. Create the Templates Folder and HTML File

Inside **Project_Folder**, create a new folder named **templates**.
Open Notepad again and create a file named **index.html**.
Paste the corresponding HTML code (also available in the **week-01** folder), select **"All Files"**, and save it inside the **templates** folder.

#### 4. Install Flask

Open **Command Prompt** and install Flask by running:

*pip install flask*

Then set the Flask application environment variable:

*set FLASK_APP=app.py*

#### 5. Install Python Extension in Visual Studio Code

If Visual Studio Code is not installed, download and install it.
Inside VS Code, go to **Extensions** (left sidebar) and install the **Python extension**.

#### 6. Run the Application

Open the **app.py** file in VS Code and run one of the following commands:

##### Option A: Through Visual Studio Code terminal
*python app.py*

##### Option B: Through Command Prompt

Navigate to the project directory:

*cd C:\Project_Folder*

Then run:

*python app.py*

#### 7. Access the Web Page

If everything is set up correctly, the terminal will display a line similar to:

*Running on http://localhost:5000/*


Open that URL in your browser, and the page will display the messages:

**Hello!**

**Welcome!**

**This is a message.**







### 2️⃣ PHP Setup
#### 1. Download and Install PHP

Go to the official PHP for Windows download page:

*https://windows.php.net/download/*

Download the **Thread Safe ZIP package** for your system and extract the files into a new folder named **php** in:

C:\


After extraction, your folder should look like:

C:\php\

#### 2. Create the PHP File (index.php)

Inside the C:\php folder, create a new file named **index.php** using Notepad.
Select **"All Files"** when saving, and paste the PHP code provided in the **week-01** folder.

Example structure:

C:\php\
   └── index.php

#### 3. Install the PHP Extension in Visual Studio Code

Open Visual Studio Code → Go to **Extensions** → Install the extension named **"PHP"**
(This enables syntax highlighting and support for PHP code.)

#### 4. Run the PHP Development Server

Open **Command Prompt** and navigate to the PHP folder:

*cd C:\php*


Start the built-in PHP development server:

*php -S localhost:8080*


If everything is correct, the server will start on port 8080.

#### 5. Open the Web Page in Your Browser

Open your browser and visit:

*http://localhost:8080*


You should now see the displayed messages:

**Hello!**

**Welcome!**

**This is a message.**

After setting up the basic web servers using Python and PHP, the next step was to prepare the environment required for data storage and dynamic content management. For this purpose, a relational database system was introduced, using MySQL, which allows the application to store, retrieve, and manage library-related data efficiently (such as book information, categories, and user activity).

Additionally, the setup process included the installation and configuration of the Apache HTTP Server, which provides a stable, production-level environment for serving PHP applications. Apache enables the web server to deliver PHP pages reliably and is commonly used in combination with MySQL to create full-stack web applications.

The following sections describe the installation steps for MySQL and Apache, as well as how they integrate with the overall project architecture.


### 3️⃣ MySQL Database (MySQL Server)

**MySQL** is one of the most widely used relational database systems, ideal for web applications like the ones developed during this project.

### Installation Steps (Windows)
#### 1. Download MySQL Installer

Visit the official MySQL download page:

*https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/*


Download the *latest MySQL Installer* for Windows.

#### 2. Run the Installer

Open the downloaded file and choose:

*Full*


This installs:

- MySQL Server

- MySQL Workbench

- MySQL Shell

- Utilities and connectors required for development

Then click:

*Next → Execute*

This installs all selected products.

#### 3. Complete Configuration

During the setup:

Create your **MySQL root account** (username + password)

Choose the default configuration options

Finalize the installation

When the process finishes, MySQL Workbench will be available for use.








## Apache, without XAMPP and WAMP

Steps for web server: on site: https://www.apachelounge.com/download/ and install the appropriate one

new file -> path C:\Apache24  and extract all files from download there

sto path: C:\Apache24\conf\httpd.conf open last file, make sure the line: Define SRVROOT "/Apache24" deixnei: Define SRVROOT "c:/Apache24" and make sure that the lines below are exist without #:

  LoadModule php_module "c:/php/php8apache2_4.dll"

  AddType application/x-httpd-php .php


  PHPIniDir "C:/php"


and save the file



στο cmd as admin -> write: 

cd C:\Apache24\bin
httpd.exe -k install, service is installed



in the same terminal write: httpd.exe -k start


browser -> give localhost and then if it is ok appears the message: "It works!"

(php and Apache24 in the same path C:\)
