## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

During the internship, I worked with the following technologies to build a complete web development environment:

| Technology / Tool | Purpose | Emoji |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----- |
| 🐍 **Python (Flask)** | Lightweight web server to display messages and handle HTML templates | `localhost:5000` |
| 🐘 **PHP** | Runs via built-in PHP server or Apache for dynamic web pages | `localhost:8080 / 80` |
| ⚡ **Apache HTTP Server** | Serves PHP pages in a stable, production-like environment | `localhost:80` |
| 💾 **MySQL Database** | Stores and manages data such as books, users, and categories | Database management |
| 🖥️ **Visual Studio Code** | Main IDE for development | Code editing & extensions |
| 🔌 **VS Code Extensions** | Python, PHP extensions | Syntax highlighting & tools |
| 🐳 **Command Prompt / Terminal** | Running servers, installing packages | CLI commands |

## 📖 Project Overview

The internship involved setting up a **development stack** for a simple library system:

1. **Python (Flask)**:  
   - Lightweight server to display messages  
   - Handles HTML templates in the `templates` folder  
   - Runs on `localhost:5000`

2. **PHP**:  
   - Can run via the built-in server (`localhost:8080`)  
   - Can also be served via Apache (`localhost:80`) for a production-like setup  

3. **MySQL Database**:  
   - Stores book records, categories, and user activity  
   - Provides structured data access for web applications  

4. **Apache HTTP Server**:  
   - Serves PHP applications reliably  
   - Provides a stable local web server environment  

This setup forms the **foundation for building more advanced features** in the library management system.

## ⚙️ Setup Summary

- **Python / Flask**:  
  - Install Python → Install Flask → Run `app.py`  
  - Access web page: `http://localhost:5000`

- **PHP**:  
  - Install PHP → Create `index.php` → Run PHP server  
  - Access web page: `http://localhost:8080`

- **MySQL**:  
  - Install MySQL Server & Workbench  
  - Configure root account & default options

- **Apache**:  
  - Install Apache → Configure `httpd.conf` for PHP → Start server  
  - Access web page: `http://localhost`

---

## 📌 Notes

- All servers run on **localhost** and are **only accessible from the local machine**  
- Paths for PHP and Apache are set to `C:\php` and `C:\Apache24`  
- Python Flask server runs independently and can coexist with Apache + PHP  

---

## 🎯 Goals Achieved

- ✅ Set up a working development environment  
- ✅ Built basic Python and PHP web servers  
- ✅ Connected servers to a MySQL database  
- ✅ Ran Apache to serve PHP pages  
- ✅ Learned the integration of web server, database, and dynamic content
